# Computer Graphics and Interaction
Laborations in [Computer Graphics and Interaction (DH2323)](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DH2323?l=en) at KTH

## About the course
The course consists of three labs and one project. In the beginning of the course you choose a track; Rendering or Real-Time Animation. 
I started the Real-Time Animation track, but due to miscommunication from the course administration about the required OS for each track,  I had
to change track to Rendering in the middle of the course.

### The labs
The first lab was an introduction to 2D/3D graphics and the development environment. [Instructions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wdbIjvNsQuAzu7PqwjURnDnUnwBCctW7)
The Rendering track had two labs; /Ray1 and /Ray2.
The first lab was about [ray tracing](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pGZNlrv8e1UuHTFg-L3nunwncFW7TUqb), and the second about [rasterisation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zbTcJeWHrt4eHReNo7EVRcLbevkHlMRf).

### The project
For the project I built a simple puzzle game in the OpenGL Library GLUT. A blog about the project work can be found [here](http://interpoluzzle.blogspot.com)
