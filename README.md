# Computer Graphics and Interaction
Laborations in Computer Graphics and Interaction (DH2323) at KTH

## About the course
The course consists of three labs and one project. In the beginning of the course you choose a track; Rendering or Real-Time Animation. 
I started the Real-Time Animation track, but due to miscommunication from the course administration about the required OS for each track,  I had
to change track to Rendering in the middle of the course.

### The labs
The first lab was an introduction to 2D/3D graphics and the development environment.
The Rendering track had two labs; /Ray1 and /Ray2. The first lab was about ray tracing, and the second about rasterisation.

### The project
For the project I built a simple puzzle game in the GLUT library
